## 🚀 What I Work On

### LLM Agents & Automation
Building intelligent agents powered by large language models, including multi-tool search systems, automated email workflows, and voice-enabled conversational interfaces.

### Deep Learning & NLP
Developing neural network architectures for natural language processing tasks, sentiment analysis, and classification problems using TensorFlow and PyTorch.

### Full-Stack AI Applications
Creating end-to-end AI-powered applications with modern web frameworks, focusing on seamless user experiences and robust backend systems.
